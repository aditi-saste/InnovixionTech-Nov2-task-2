Project Description: Alarm Clock Application

1. Functionality:

Setting Alarm:
         
Users can set an alarm by entering the desired time (hour, minute, second) in the respective entry boxes. They can also select AM or PM using radio buttons.
Increment and Decrement: Users can fine-tune the alarm time by incrementing or decrementing the hour, minute, and second values using the corresponding buttons.
Starting Alarm: Upon clicking the "Set Alarm" button, the application schedules the alarm to trigger at the specified time.
Stopping Alarm: Users can stop the alarm manually by clicking the "Stop Alarm" button.
Visual Feedback: The application provides visual feedback on the alarm status, indicating whether the alarm is set or stopped.

2. User Interface:

Digital Clock: 

The top portion of the interface displays a digital clock that updates in real-time.
Input Fields: Below the clock, users can input the alarm time using separate entry boxes for hour, minute, and second.
AM/PM Selection: Radio buttons allow users to select either AM or PM for the alarm time.
Increment/Decrement Buttons: Increment (▲) and decrement (▼) buttons are provided next to each entry box to adjust the time values.
Control Buttons: Buttons for setting and stopping the alarm are available for user interaction.
Alarm Status: A label below the control buttons displays the current status of the alarm, providing feedback to the user.

3. Implementation:

Python with Tkinter: 

The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using the Tkinter library in Python.
Threading: Threading is used to run the alarm function concurrently with the main GUI loop, allowing the alarm to trigger independently of the interface.
Datetime Module: The datetime module is utilized for time-related operations, such as formatting the current time and parsing user input for alarm setting.
Pygame: Pygame library is employed to handle audio playback for the alarm sound.
Error Handling: The application includes error handling to validate user input and provide informative messages in case of invalid input.

4. Customization:

Users can customize the alarm sound by replacing the audio file path in the code.
Additional features or enhancements, such as snooze functionality or multiple alarm support, can be implemented to extend the application's capabilities.
Overall, this alarm clock application provides a user-friendly interface for setting and managing alarms, making it a handy tool for time management and scheduling reminders.
